### **Large Language Model Application Intern**

**Aug 2024 – Jun 2025 | Zhicheng Technology Co., Ltd.**

Developed a travel survey simulation framework based on large language models, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities to better replicate travel behavior. Specifically, constructed the *Chain-of-Trips* dataset (linking travel chains to chains of thought) and implemented a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning via GRPO. This approach significantly improved the model’s performance in travel behavior simulation and motivation inference.
