## 👋 About Me

My name is **Peijie Liu**, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Electronic Engineering** at **Tsinghua University**(2023–2026). I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in **Automation** from **Xi'an Jiaotong University**(2019–2023).

I have always been fascinated by the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **real-world applications**. My research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **LLM Agents**, and **Data Mining**, and I am particularly interested in exploring how these technologies can transform industries such as transportation, education, and decision-making.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy reading books on technology and society and love exploring new scientific developments. I am also passionate about **running** , **table tennis** and frequently enjoy hiking in nature, which helps me stay balanced and fuels my creativity.

As a researcher, I am driven by a deep curiosity and the desire to make a meaningful impact on the world. I am excited to continue working on **AI-powered decision-making systems** and collaborate with other researchers to push the boundaries of **LLMs** and **data intelligence**.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in discussing research, AI, or new ideas!

## 🧪 Research Experience

### 1. 🔐 **Token Signature** – *ICML 2025* **[Poster, First Author]**

Discovered that monotonicity in token probability distributions predicts the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Proposed two lightweight metrics and a **Dynamic CoT** framework that achieves **89.2% prediction accuracy** while reducing token usage by  **over 35%** .

### 2. 🚶 TravelReasoner – *Tsinghua–Guizhou Big Data Excellence Project* **[Awarded]**

Collaborated with **Guizhou Zhicheng Technology** to build a large-scale dataset mapping travel diaries to reasoning chains. Leveraged a two-stage **SFT** pipeline to train an LLM-based reasoning simulator for travel surveys.

### 3. 🤖 **AgentRecBench** – *NeurIPS 2025* **[Spotlight, Co-First Author]**

Built  **AgentSociety** , the first unified benchmark and simulator for  **LLM-agent-based recommender systems** . Supports classical, interest-evolution, and cold-start scenarios across 10+ baseline methods.

### 4. 🎬 **Short-Form Video Ecosystem** – *CSCW 2026* **[Under Review, Co-First Author]**

Analyzed **hundreds of millions** of records from Kuaishou and Bilibili to reveal how short-form video platforms lower content barriers and  **democratize virality** . Quantified the platform mechanisms amplifying ordinary creators’ reach.
